(** * Evidence-carrying booleans. *)

(** So far we've seen two different forms of equality predicates:
[eq], which produces a [Prop], and
the type-specific forms, like [beq_nat], that produce [boolean]
values.  The former are more convenient to reason about, but
we've relied on the latter to let us use equality tests 
in _computations_.  While it is straightforward to write lemmas
(e.g. [beq_nat_true] and [beq_nat_false]) that connect the two forms,
using these lemmas quickly gets tedious. 

It turns out that we can get the benefits of both forms at once 
by using a construct called [sumbool]. *)

Inductive sumbool (A B : Prop) : Set :=
 | left : A -> sumbool A B 
 | right : B -> sumbool A B.

Notation "{ A } + { B }" :=  (sumbool A B) : type_scope.

(** Think of [sumbool] as being like the [boolean] type, but instead
of its values being just [true] and [false], they carry _evidence_
of truth or falsity. This means that when we [destruct] them, we
are left with the relevant evidence as a hypothesis -- just as with [or].
(In fact, the definition of [sumbool] is almost the same as for [or].
The only difference is that values of [sumbool] are declared to be in
[Set] rather than in [Prop]; this is a technical distinction 
that allows us to compute with them.) *) 

(** Here's how we can define a [sumbool] for equality on [nat]s *)

Theorem eq_nat_dec : forall n m : nat, {n = m} + {n <> m}.
Proof.
  intros n.
  induction n as [|n'].
    intros m.
    destruct m as [|m'].
      left. reflexivity.
      right. intros contra. inversion contra.
    intros m.
    destruct m as [|m'].
      right. intros contra. inversion contra.
      destruct IHn' with (m := m') as [eq | neq].
      left. apply f_equal.  apply eq.
      right. intros Heq. inversion Heq as [Heq']. apply neq. apply Heq'.
Defined. 

(** Read as a theorem, this says that equality on [nat]s is decidable:
that is, given two [nat] values, we can always produce either 
evidence that they are equal or evidence that they are not.
Read computationally, [eq_nat_dec] takes two [nat] values and returns
a [sumbool] constructed with [left] if they are equal and [right] 
if they are not; this result can be tested with a [match] or, better,
with an [if-then-else], just like a regular [boolean]. 
(Notice that we ended this proof with [Defined] rather than [Qed]. 
The only difference this makes is that the proof becomes _transparent_,
meaning that its definition is available when Coq tries to do reductions,
which is important for the computational interpretation.)

Here's a simple example illustrating the advantages of the [sumbool] form. *)

Definition override' {X: Type} (f: nat->X) (k:nat) (x:X) : nat->X:=
  fun (k':nat) => if eq_nat_dec k k' then x else f k'.

Theorem override_same' : forall (X:Type) x1 k1 k2 (f : nat->X),
  f k1 = x1 -> 
  (override' f k1 x1) k2 = f k2.
Proof.
  intros X x1 k1 k2 f. intros Hx1.
  unfold override'.
  destruct (eq_nat_dec k1 k2).   (* observe what appears as a hypothesis *)
  Case "k1 = k2".
    rewrite <- e.
    symmetry. apply Hx1.
  Case "k1 <> k2". 
    reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Compare this to the more laborious proof (in MoreCoq.v) for the 
   version of [override] defined using [beq_nat], where we had to
   use the auxiliary lemma [beq_nat_true] to convert a fact about booleans
   to a Prop. *)


(** **** Exercise: 1 star (override_shadow') *)
Theorem override_shadow' : forall (X:Type) x1 x2 k1 k2 (f : nat->X),
  (override' (override' f k1 x2) k1 x1) k2 = (override' f k1 x1) k2.
Proof.

(** ** Inversion, Again (Advanced) *)

(** We've seen [inversion] used with both equality hypotheses and
    hypotheses about inductively defined propositions.  Now that we've
    seen that these are actually the same thing, we're in a position
    to take a closer look at how [inversion] behaves...

    In general, the [inversion] tactic

    - takes a hypothesis [H] whose type [P] is inductively defined,
      and

    - for each constructor [C] in [P]'s definition,

      - generates a new subgoal in which we assume [H] was
        built with [C],

      - adds the arguments (premises) of [C] to the context of
        the subgoal as extra hypotheses,

      - matches the conclusion (result type) of [C] against the
        current goal and calculates a set of equalities that must
        hold in order for [C] to be applicable,
        
      - adds these equalities to the context (and, for convenience,
        rewrites them in the goal), and

      - if the equalities are not satisfiable (e.g., they involve
        things like [S n = O]), immediately solves the subgoal. *)

(** _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [or], there are two
   constructors, so two subgoals get generated.  The
   conclusion (result type) of the constructor ([P \/ Q]) doesn't
   place any restrictions on the form of [P] or [Q], so we don't get
   any extra equalities in the context of the subgoal.

   _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [and], there is
   only one constructor, so only one subgoal gets generated.  Again,
   the conclusion (result type) of the constructor ([P /\ Q]) doesn't
   place any restrictions on the form of [P] or [Q], so we don't get
   any extra equalities in the context of the subgoal.  The
   constructor does have two arguments, though, and these can be seen
   in the context in the subgoal.

   _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [eq], there is
   again only one constructor, so only one subgoal gets generated.
   Now, though, the form of the [refl_equal] constructor does give us
   some extra information: it tells us that the two arguments to [eq]
   must be the same!  The [inversion] tactic adds this fact to the
   context.  *)
