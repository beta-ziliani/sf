(** * Imp: Simple Imperative Programs *)

(** In this chapter, we begin a new direction that will continue for
    the rest of the course.  Up to now most of our attention has been
    focused on various aspects of Coq itself, while from now on we'll
    mostly be using Coq to formalize other things.  (We'll continue to
    pause from time to time to introduce a few additional aspects of
    Coq.)

    Our first case study is a _simple imperative programming language_
    called Imp, embodying a tiny core fragment of conventional
    mainstream languages such as C and Java.  Here is a familiar
    mathematical function written in Imp.
     Z ::= X;;
     Y ::= 1;;
     WHILE not (Z = 0) DO
       Y ::= Y * Z;;
       Z ::= Z - 1
     END
*)

(** This chapter looks at how to define the _syntax_ and _semantics_
    of Imp; the chapters that follow develop a theory of _program
    equivalence_ and introduce _Hoare Logic_, a widely used logic for
    reasoning about imperative programs. *)

(* ####################################################### *)

Require Import ssreflect.

(** *** Sflib *)

(** A minor technical point: Instead of asking Coq to import our
    earlier definitions from chapter [Logic], we import a small library
    called [Sflib.v], containing just a few definitions and theorems
    from earlier chapters that we'll actually use in the rest of the
    course.  This change should be nearly invisible, since most of what's
    missing from Sflib has identical definitions in the Coq standard
    library.  The main reason for doing it is to tidy the global Coq
    environment so that, for example, it is easier to search for
    relevant theorems. *)

Require Export SfLib.

(* ####################################################### *)
(** * Arithmetic and Boolean Expressions *)

(** We'll present Imp in three parts: first a core language of
    _arithmetic and boolean expressions_, then an extension of these
    expressions with _variables_, and finally a language of _commands_
    including assignment, conditions, sequencing, and loops. *)

(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Syntax *)

Module AExp.

(** These two definitions specify the _abstract syntax_ of
    arithmetic and boolean expressions. *)

Inductive aexp : Type :=
  | ANum : nat -> aexp
  | APlus : aexp -> aexp -> aexp
  | AMinus : aexp -> aexp -> aexp
  | AMult : aexp -> aexp -> aexp.

Inductive bexp : Type :=
  | BTrue : bexp
  | BFalse : bexp
  | BEq : aexp -> aexp -> bexp
  | BLe : aexp -> aexp -> bexp
  | BNot : bexp -> bexp
  | BAnd : bexp -> bexp -> bexp.

(** In this chapter, we'll elide the translation from the
    concrete syntax that a programmer would actually write to these
    abstract syntax trees -- the process that, for example, would
    translate the string ["1+2*3"] to the AST [APlus (ANum
    1) (AMult (ANum 2) (ANum 3))].  The optional chapter [ImpParser]
    develops a simple implementation of a lexical analyzer and parser
    that can perform this translation.  You do _not_ need to
    understand that file to understand this one, but if you haven't
    taken a course where these techniques are covered (e.g., a
    compilers course) you may want to skim it. *)

(** For comparison, here's a conventional BNF (Backus-Naur Form)
    grammar defining the same abstract syntax:
    a ::= nat
        | a + a
        | a - a
        | a * a

    b ::= true
        | false
        | a = a
        | a <= a
        | b and b
        | not b
*)

(** Compared to the Coq version above...

       - The BNF is more informal -- for example, it gives some
         suggestions about the surface syntax of expressions (like the
         fact that the addition operation is written [+] and is an
         infix symbol) while leaving other aspects of lexical analysis
         and parsing (like the relative precedence of [+], [-], and
         [*]) unspecified.  Some additional information -- and human
         intelligence -- would be required to turn this description
         into a formal definition (when implementing a compiler, for
         example).

         The Coq version consistently omits all this information and
         concentrates on the abstract syntax only.

       - On the other hand, the BNF version is lighter and
         easier to read.  Its informality makes it flexible, which is
         a huge advantage in situations like discussions at the
         blackboard, where conveying general ideas is more important
         than getting every detail nailed down precisely.

         Indeed, there are dozens of BNF-like notations and people
         switch freely among them, usually without bothering to say which
         form of BNF they're using because there is no need to: a
         rough-and-ready informal understanding is all that's
         needed. *)

(** It's good to be comfortable with both sorts of notations:
    informal ones for communicating between humans and formal ones for
    carrying out implementations and proofs. *)

(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Evaluation *)

(** _Evaluating_ an arithmetic expression produces a number. *)

Fixpoint aeval (a : aexp) : nat :=
  match a with
  | ANum n => n
  | APlus a1 a2 => (aeval a1) + (aeval a2)
  | AMinus a1 a2  => (aeval a1) - (aeval a2)
  | AMult a1 a2 => (aeval a1) * (aeval a2)
  end.

Example test_aeval1:
  aeval (APlus (ANum 2) (ANum 2)) = 4.
Proof. by []. Qed.

(** Similarly, evaluating a boolean expression yields a boolean. *)

Fixpoint beval (b : bexp) : bool :=
  match b with
  | BTrue       => true
  | BFalse      => false
  | BEq a1 a2   => (aeval a1) == (aeval a2)
  | BLe a1 a2   => (aeval a1) <= (aeval a2)
  | BNot b1     => ~~ (beval b1)
  | BAnd b1 b2  => (beval b1) && (beval b2)
  end.

(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Optimization *)

(** We haven't defined very much yet, but we can already get
    some mileage out of the definitions.  Suppose we define a function
    that takes an arithmetic expression and slightly simplifies it,
    changing every occurrence of [0+e] (i.e., [(APlus (ANum 0) e])
    into just [e]. *)

Fixpoint optimize_0plus (a:aexp) : aexp :=
  match a with
  | ANum n =>
      ANum n
  | APlus (ANum 0) e2 =>
      optimize_0plus e2
  | APlus e1 e2 =>
      APlus (optimize_0plus e1) (optimize_0plus e2)
  | AMinus e1 e2 =>
      AMinus (optimize_0plus e1) (optimize_0plus e2)
  | AMult e1 e2 =>
      AMult (optimize_0plus e1) (optimize_0plus e2)
  end.

(** To make sure our optimization is doing the right thing we
    can test it on some examples and see if the output looks OK. *)

Example test_optimize_0plus:
  optimize_0plus (APlus (ANum 2)
                        (APlus (ANum 0)
                               (APlus (ANum 0) (ANum 1))))
  = APlus (ANum 2) (ANum 1).
Proof. by []. Qed.

(** But if we want to be sure the optimization is correct --
    i.e., that evaluating an optimized expression gives the same
    result as the original -- we should prove it. *)

Theorem optimize_0plus_sound: forall a,
  aeval (optimize_0plus a) = aeval a.

(** * Coq Automation *)

(** The repetition in this last proof is starting to be a little
    annoying.  If either the language of arithmetic expressions or the
    optimization being proved sound were significantly more complex,
    it would begin to be a real problem.

    So far, we've been doing all our proofs using just a small handful
    of Coq's tactics and completely ignoring its powerful facilities
    for constructing parts of proofs automatically.  This section
    introduces some of these facilities, and we will see more over the
    next several chapters.  Getting used to them will take some
    energy -- Coq's automation is a power tool -- but it will allow us
    to scale up our efforts to more complex definitions and more
    interesting properties without becoming overwhelmed by boring,
    repetitive, low-level details. *)


(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Tacticals *)

(** We have seen _tacticals_ before. They are tactics that take other
    tactics as arguments -- "higher-order tactics," if you will.  *)

(* ####################################################### *)
(** *** The [do] Tactical *)

(** The [do] tactical allows several applications of a tactic. Here is
    an example showing that [100] is even using [do]. *)

Theorem ev100 : ev 100.
Proof.
  do ! apply: ev_SS.   (* applies ev_SS 50 times,
                           until [apply ev_SS] fails *)
  by apply: ev_0.
Qed.


(** The [!] in the proof above indicates that we want to try until it
    is not possible to continue applying the tactic.  We can specify
    the number of iterations by providing the number before the [!].
*)
Theorem ev100' : ev 100.
Proof.
  do 50! apply: ev_SS.   (* applies ev_SS exactly 50 times *)
  by apply: ev_0.
Qed.

(** The [!] requires at least one application to succeed. *)
Theorem ev100'_fail : ev 100.
Proof.
  Fail do ! apply: ev_0.   (* fail to apply ev_0 *)
Abort.

(** We can use the [?] mark to allow 0 or more applications of a
    tactic.  For the moment it will be useless, but we will probably
    encounter places where it will become handy. *)

Theorem ev100'' : ev 100.
Proof.
  do ? apply: ev_0. (* does not fail *)
Abort.


(* ####################################################### *)
(** *** The [try] Tactical *)

(** If [T] is a tactic, then [try T] is a tactic that is just like [T]
    except that, if [T] fails, [try T] _successfully_ does nothing at
    all (instead of failing). *)

Theorem silly1 ae : aeval ae = aeval ae.
Proof. try by []. (* this just does [by []] *) Qed.

Theorem silly2 (P Q: Prop) : (P -> Q) -> P -> Q.
Proof.
  move=> HPQ xP.
  try by []. (* just [by []] would have failed *)
  by apply: HPQ. (* we can still finish the proof in some other way *)
Qed.

(** Using [try] in a completely manual proof is a bit silly, but
    we'll see below that [try] is very useful for doing automated
    proofs in conjunction with the [;] tactical. *)

(* ####################################################### *)
(** *** The [;] Tactical (Simple Form) *)

(** In its most commonly used form, the [;] tactical takes two tactics
    as argument: [T;T'] first performs the tactic [T] and then
    performs the tactic [T'] on _each subgoal_ generated by [T]. *)

(** For example, consider the following trivial lemma: *)

Lemma foo : forall n, 0 < n + 1.
Proof.
  case => [|n].
    (* Leaves two subgoals, which are discharged identically...  *)
  - simpl_nat. by [].
  simpl_nat. by [].
Qed.

(** We can simplify this proof using the [;] tactical: *)

Lemma foo' : forall n, 0 < n + 1.
Proof.
  case => [|n]; (* [case] the current goal *)
  simpl_nat; (* then [simpl_nat] each resulting subgoal *)
  by []. (* and conclude on each resulting subgoal *)
Qed.

(** (Actually, in this example, the [;] is not really need .) *)
Lemma foo'' : forall n, 0 <= n.
Proof.  by case.  Qed.


(** Using [try] and [;] together, we can get rid of the repetition in
    the proof that was bothering us a little while ago. *)

Theorem optimize_0plus_sound': forall a,
  aeval (optimize_0plus a) = aeval a.
Proof.
  elim =>[n | a1 IHa1 a2 IHa2 | a1 IHa1 a2 IHa2 | a1 IHa1 a2 IHa2];
    (* Most cases follow directly by the IH *)
    try by rewrite /= IHa1; rewrite IHa2.
  (* The remaining cases -- ANum and APlus -- are different *)
    (* Case "ANum". *) 
    - by [].
  (* Case "APlus". *)
  case: a1 IHa1 => [n | a1' a2' | a1' a2' | a1' a2'] IHa1;
      (* Again, most cases follow directly by the IH *)
      try by rewrite /= in IHa1 *; rewrite IHa1;
           rewrite IHa2.
    (* The interesting case, on which the [try...] does nothing,
       is when [e1 = ANum n]. In this case, we have to case
       [n] (to see whether the optimization applies) and rewrite
       with the induction hypothesis. *)
  (* SCase "a1 = ANum n". *)
  by case: n {IHa1}; rewrite /= IHa2.
Qed.


(** Coq experts often use this "[...; try... ]" idiom after a tactic
    like [elim] to take care of many similar cases all at once.
    Naturally, this practice has an analog in informal proofs.

    Here is an informal proof of this theorem that matches the
    structure of the formal one:

    _Theorem_: For all arithmetic expressions [a],
       aeval (optimize_0plus a) = aeval a.
    _Proof_: By induction on [a].  The [AMinus] and [AMult] cases
    follow directly from the IH.  The remaining cases are as follows:

      - Suppose [a = ANum n] for some [n].  We must show
          aeval (optimize_0plus (ANum n)) = aeval (ANum n).
        This is immediate from the definition of [optimize_0plus].

      - Suppose [a = APlus a1 a2] for some [a1] and [a2].  We
        must show
          aeval (optimize_0plus (APlus a1 a2))
        = aeval (APlus a1 a2).
        Consider the possible forms of [a1].  For most of them,
        [optimize_0plus] simply calls itself recursively for the
        subexpressions and rebuilds a new expression of the same form
        as [a1]; in these cases, the result follows directly from the
        IH.

        The interesting case is when [a1 = ANum n] for some [n].
        If [n = ANum 0], then
          optimize_0plus (APlus a1 a2) = optimize_0plus a2
        and the IH for [a2] is exactly what we need.  On the other
        hand, if [n = S n'] for some [n'], then again [optimize_0plus]
        simply calls itself recursively, and the result follows from
        the IH.  [] *)

(** This proof can still be improved: the first case (for [a = ANum
    n]) is very trivial -- even more trivial than the cases that we
    said simply followed from the IH -- yet we have chosen to write it
    out in full.  It would be better and clearer to drop it and just
    say, at the top, "Most cases are either immediate or direct from
    the IH.  The only interesting case is the one for [APlus]..."  We
    can make the same improvement in our formal proof too.  More
    specifically, in the formal proof we say "The first case is
    trivial, and most of the other cases can be solved by the IH."  *)

(** Since we are distinguishing the first case from the rest of the
    cases, we can also remove the redundancy in the naming of the
    variables.  That is, instead of writing [elim => [n | a1 IHa1 a2
    IHa2 | a1 IHa1 a2 IHa2 | a1 IHa1 a2 IHa2]] we can avoid
    introducing them, and let the tactic [move] do it for the last
    three cases. *)

Theorem optimize_0plus_sound'': forall a,
  aeval (optimize_0plus a) = aeval a.
Proof.
  elim; (* No names introduced! *)
    (* The first case is trivial. *)
    first 1 [by []]
    (* In the rest of the cases we introduce the names and try
    directly by the IH *) 
    || (move=>a1 IHa1 a2 IHa2; try by rewrite /= IHa1 IHa2).
  (* The remaining case APlus *)
  case: a1 IHa1;
    (* The first case is the special one, so we keep it untouched.
    This is done with the [idtac] tactic, which can be thought of as
    the [skip] instruction in assembler: it does nothing. *)
    first 1 [idtac]
    || (move=>a1' a2' IHa1 ;
       (* Again, most cases follow directly by the IH *)
        by rewrite /= in IHa1 *; rewrite IHa1 IHa2).
    (* The interesting case, on which [idtac] does nothing,
       is when [e1 = ANum n]. In this case, we have to case
       [n] (to see whether the optimization applies) and rewrite
       with the induction hypothesis. *)
  (* SCase "a1 = ANum n". *)
  by case; rewrite /= IHa2.
Qed.


(** Here is another option: kill the first case and then solve the
    rest of the goals.  Notice the subtle difference: while in the
    previous proof the first case was treated differently from the
    rest, in the proof below we are removing it from the proof stack
    prior to solving the rest of the goals.  If in the proof below the
    first case is not eliminated, then the rest of the tactics
    following the [;] will get applied to the first case. *)
Theorem optimize_0plus_sound''': forall a, 
  aeval (optimize_0plus a) = aeval a.
Proof.  
  elim; first by []; 
    move=>a1 IHa1 a2 IHa2; try by rewrite /= IHa1 IHa2.
  (* The remaining case APlus *)
  case: a1 IHa1; 
    first (by case; rewrite /= IHa2);
    by move=>a1' a2' /= IHa1; rewrite IHa1 IHa2.
Qed.

(** Analogous to [first], Ssreflect also have a [last]. *)


(* ####################################################### *)
(** *** The [;] Tactical (General Form) *)

(** The [;] tactical has a more general than the simple [T;T'] we've
    seen above, which is sometimes also useful.  If [T], [T1], ...,
    [Tn] are tactics, then
      T; [T1 | T2 | ... | Tn]
   is a tactic that first performs [T] and then performs [T1] on the
   first subgoal generated by [T], performs [T2] on the second
   subgoal, etc.

   So [T;T'] is just special notation for the case when all of the
   [Ti]'s are the same tactic; i.e. [T;T'] is just a shorthand for:
      T; [T' | T' | ... | T']
*)


(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (optimize_0plus_b) *)
(** Since the [optimize_0plus] tranformation doesn't change the value
    of [aexp]s, we should be able to apply it to all the [aexp]s that
    appear in a [bexp] without changing the [bexp]'s value.  Write a
    function which performs that transformation on [bexp]s, and prove
    it is sound.  Use the tacticals we've just seen to make the proof
    as elegant as possible. *)

(** * Evaluation as a Relation *)

(** We have presented [aeval] and [beval] as functions defined by
    [Fixpoints].  Another way to think about evaluation -- one that we
    will see is often more flexible -- is as a _relation_ between
    expressions and their values.  This leads naturally to [Inductive]
    definitions like the following one for arithmetic
    expressions... *)

Module aevalR_first_try.

Inductive aevalR : aexp -> nat -> Prop :=
  | E_ANum  : forall (n: nat),
      aevalR (ANum n) n
  | E_APlus : forall (e1 e2: aexp) (n1 n2: nat),
      aevalR e1 n1 ->
      aevalR e2 n2 ->
      aevalR (APlus e1 e2) (n1 + n2)
  | E_AMinus: forall (e1 e2: aexp) (n1 n2: nat),

      aevalR e1 n1 ->
      aevalR e2 n2 ->
      aevalR (AMult e1 e2) (n1 * n2).

(** As is often the case with relations, we'll find it
    convenient to define infix notation for [aevalR].  We'll write [e
    || n] to mean that arithmetic expression [e] evaluates to value
    [n].  (This notation is one place where the limitation to ASCII
    symbols becomes a little bothersome.  The standard notation for
    the evaluation relation is a double down-arrow.  We'll typeset it
    like this in the HTML version of the notes and use a double
    vertical bar as the closest approximation in [.v] files.)  *)

Notation "e '||' n" := (aevalR e n) : type_scope.

End aevalR_first_try.

(** In fact, Coq provides a way to use this notation in the definition
    of [aevalR] itself.  This avoids situations where we're working on
    a proof involving statements in the form [e || n] but we have to
    refer back to a definition written using the form [aevalR e n].

    We do this by first "reserving" the notation, then giving the
    definition together with a declaration of what the notation
    means. *)

(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Inference Rule Notation *)

(** In informal discussions, it is convenient write the rules for
    [aevalR] and similar relations in the more readable graphical form
    of _inference rules_, where the premises above the line justify
    the conclusion below the line (we have already seen them in the
    Prop chapter). *)

(** For example, the constructor [E_APlus]...
      | E_APlus : forall (e1 e2: aexp) (n1 n2: nat),
          aevalR e1 n1 ->
          aevalR e2 n2 ->
          aevalR (APlus e1 e2) (n1 + n2)

(** Formally, there is nothing very deep about inference rules:
    they are just implications.  You can read the rule name on the
    right as the name of the constructor and read each of the
    linebreaks between the premises above the line and the line itself
    as [->].  All the variables mentioned in the rule ([e1], [n1],
    etc.) are implicitly bound by universal quantifiers at the
    beginning. (Such variables are often called _metavariables_ to
    distinguish them from the variables of the language we are
    defining.  At the moment, our arithmetic expressions don't include
    variables, but we'll soon be adding them.)  The whole collection
    of rules is understood as being wrapped in an [Inductive]
    declaration (informally, this is either elided or else indicated
    by saying something like "Let [aevalR] be the smallest relation
    closed under the following rules..."). *)

(** For example, [||] is the smallest relation closed under these
    rules:

(** ** Computational vs. Relational Definitions *)

(** For the definitions of evaluation for arithmetic and boolean
    expressions, the choice of whether to use functional or relational
    definitions is mainly a matter of taste.  In general, Coq has
    somewhat better support for working with relations.  On the other
    hand, in some sense function definitions carry more information,
    because functions are necessarily deterministic and defined on all
    arguments; for a relation we have to show these properties
    explicitly if we need them. Functions also take advantage of Coq's
    computations mechanism.

    However, there are circumstances where relational definitions of

(** * Commands *)

(** Now we are ready define the syntax and behavior of Imp
    _commands_ (often called _statements_). *)

(* ################################################### *)
(** ** Syntax *)

(** Informally, commands [c] are described by the following BNF
    grammar:
     c ::= SKIP
         | x ::= a
         | c ; c
         | WHILE b DO c END
         | IFB b THEN c ELSE c FI
    For example, here's the factorial function in Imp.
     Z ::= X;
     Y ::= 1;
     WHILE not (Z = 0) DO
       Y ::= Y * Z;
       Z ::= Z - 1
     END
   When this command terminates, the variable [Y] will contain the
   factorial of the initial value of [X].
*)

(** Here is the formal definition of the syntax of commands: *)

Inductive com : Type :=
  | CSkip : com
  | CAss : id -> aexp -> com
  | CSeq : com -> com -> com
  | CIf : bexp -> com -> com -> com
  | CWhile : bexp -> com -> com.

Tactic Notation "com_cases" tactic(first) ident(c) :=
  first;
  [ Case_aux c "SKIP" | Case_aux c "::=" | Case_aux c ";;"
  | Case_aux c "IFB" | Case_aux c "WHILE" ].

(** As usual, we can use a few [Notation] declarations to make things
    more readable.  We need to be a bit careful to avoid conflicts
    with Coq's built-in notations, so we'll keep this light -- in
    particular, we won't introduce any notations for [aexps] and
    [bexps] to avoid confusion with the numerical and boolean
    operators we've already defined.  We use the keyword [IFB] for
    conditionals instead of [IF], for similar reasons. *)

Notation "'SKIP'" :=
  CSkip.
Notation "x '::=' a" :=
  (CAss x a) (at level 60).
Notation "c1 ;; c2" :=
  (CSeq c1 c2) (at level 80, right associativity).
Notation "'WHILE' b 'DO' c 'END'" :=
  (CWhile b c) (at level 80, right associativity).
Notation "'IFB' c1 'THEN' c2 'ELSE' c3 'FI'" :=
  (CIf c1 c2 c3) (at level 80, right associativity).

(** For example, here is the factorial function again, written as a
    formal definition to Coq: *)

Definition fact_in_coq : com :=
  Z ::= AId X;;
  Y ::= ANum 1;;
  WHILE BNot (BEq (AId Z) (ANum 0)) DO

(* ################################################################ *)
(** * Evaluation *)

(** Next we need to define what it means to evaluate an Imp command.
    The fact that [WHILE] loops don't necessarily terminate makes defining
    an evaluation function tricky... *)

(* #################################### *)
(** ** Evaluation as a Function (Failed Attempt) *)

(** Here's an attempt at defining an evaluation function for commands,
    omitting the [WHILE] case. *)

Fixpoint ceval_fun_no_while (st : state) (c : com) : state :=
  match c with
    | SKIP =>
        st
    | x ::= a1 =>
        update st x (aeval st a1)
    | c1 ;; c2 =>
        let st' := ceval_fun_no_while st c1 in
        ceval_fun_no_while st' c2
    | IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI =>
        if (beval st b)
          then ceval_fun_no_while st c1
          else ceval_fun_no_while st c2
    | WHILE b DO c END =>
        st  (* bogus *)
  end.

(** In a traditional functional programming language like ML or
    Haskell we could write the [WHILE] case as follows:
<<
  Fixpoint ceval_fun (st : state) (c : com) : state :=
    match c with
      ...
      | WHILE b DO c END =>
          if (beval st b1)
            then ceval_fun st (c1; WHILE b DO c END)
            else st
    end.
>>
    Coq doesn't accept such a definition ("Error: Cannot guess
    decreasing argument of fix") because the function we want to
    define is not guaranteed to terminate. Indeed, it doesn't always
    terminate: for example, the full version of the [ceval_fun]
    function applied to the [loop] program above would never
    terminate. Since Coq is not just a functional programming
    language, but also a consistent logic, any potentially
    non-terminating function needs to be rejected. Here is
    an (invalid!) Coq program showing what would go wrong if Coq
    allowed non-terminating recursive functions:
<<
     Fixpoint loop_false (n : nat) : False := loop_false n.
>>
    That is, propositions like [False] would become provable
    (e.g. [loop_false 0] would be a proof of [False]), which
    would be a disaster for Coq's logical consistency.

    Thus, because it doesn't terminate on all inputs, the full version
    of [ceval_fun] cannot be written in Coq -- at least not without
    additional tricks (see chapter [ImpCEvalFun] if curious). *)

(* #################################### *)
(** ** Evaluation as a Relation *)

(** Here's a better way: we define [ceval] as a _relation_ rather than
    a _function_ -- i.e., we define it in [Prop] instead of [Type], as
    we did for [aevalR] above. *)

(** This is an important change.  Besides freeing us from the awkward
    workarounds that would be needed to define evaluation as a
    function, it gives us a lot more flexibility in the definition.
    For example, if we added concurrency features to the language,
    we'd want the definition of evaluation to be non-deterministic --
    i.e., not only would it not be total, it would not even be a
    partial function! *)

(** We'll use the notation [c / st || st'] for our [ceval] relation:
    [c / st || st'] means that executing program [c] in a starting
    state [st] results in an ending state [st'].  This can be
    pronounced "[c] takes state [st] to [st']".

  The task of this exercise is to write a small compiler that
  translates [aexp]s into stack machine instructions.

  The instruction set for our stack language will consist of the
  following instructions:
     - [SPush n]: Push the number [n] on the stack.
     - [SLoad x]: Load the identifier [x] from the store and push it
                  on the stack
     - [SPlus]:   Pop the two top numbers from the stack, add them, and
                  push the result onto the stack.
     - [SMinus]:  Similar, but subtract.
     - [SMult]:   Similar, but multiply. *)

Inductive sinstr : Type :=
| SPush : nat -> sinstr
| SLoad : id -> sinstr
| SPlus : sinstr
| SMinus : sinstr
| SMult : sinstr.

(** Write a function to evaluate programs in the stack language. It
    takes as input a state, a stack represented as a list of
    numbers (top stack item is the head of the list), and a program
    represented as a list of instructions, and returns the stack after
    executing the program. Test your function on the examples below.

    Note that the specification leaves unspecified what to do when
    encountering an [SPlus], [SMinus], or [SMult] instruction if the
    stack contains less than two elements.  In a sense, it is
    immaterial what we do, since our compiler will never emit such a
    malformed program. *)

    Prove the following theorem, stating that the [compile] function

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced (break_imp) *)
Module BreakImp.

(** Imperative languages such as C or Java often have a [break] or
    similar statement for interrupting the execution of loops. In this
    exercise we will consider how to add [break] to Imp.

    First, we need to enrich the language of commands with an
    additional case. *)

Inductive com : Type :=
  | CSkip : com
  | CBreak : com
  | CAss : id -> aexp -> com
  | CSeq : com -> com -> com
  | CIf : bexp -> com -> com -> com
  | CWhile : bexp -> com -> com.

Tactic Notation "com_cases" tactic(first) ident(c) :=
  first;
  [ Case_aux c "SKIP" | Case_aux c "BREAK" | Case_aux c "::=" | Case_aux c ";"
  | Case_aux c "IFB" | Case_aux c "WHILE" ].

Notation "'SKIP'" :=
  CSkip.
Notation "'BREAK'" :=
  CBreak.
Notation "x '::=' a" :=
  (CAss x a) (at level 60).
Notation "c1 ; c2" :=
  (CSeq c1 c2) (at level 80, right associativity).
Notation "'WHILE' b 'DO' c 'END'" :=
  (CWhile b c) (at level 80, right associativity).
Notation "'IFB' c1 'THEN' c2 'ELSE' c3 'FI'" :=
  (CIf c1 c2 c3) (at level 80, right associativity).

(** Next, we need to define the behavior of [BREAK].  Informally,
    whenever [BREAK] is executed in a sequence of commands, it stops
    the execution of that sequence and signals that the innermost
    enclosing loop (if any) should terminate. If there aren't any
    enclosing loops, then the whole program simply terminates. The
    final state should be the same as the one in which the [BREAK]
    statement was executed.

    One important point is what to do when there are multiple loops
    enclosing a given [BREAK]. In those cases, [BREAK] should only
    terminate the _innermost_ loop where it occurs. Thus, after
    executing the following piece of code...
   X ::= 0;
   Y ::= 1;
   WHILE 0 <> Y DO
     WHILE TRUE DO
       BREAK
     END;
     X ::= 1;
     Y ::= Y - 1
   END
    ... the value of [X] should be [1], and not [0].

    One way of expressing this behavior is to add another parameter to
    the evaluation relation that specifies whether evaluation of a
    command executes a [BREAK] statement: *)

Inductive status : Type :=
  | SContinue : status
  | SBreak : status.

Reserved Notation "c1 '/' st '||' s '/' st'"
                  (at level 40, st, s at level 39).

(** Intuitively, [c / st || s / st'] means that, if [c] is started in
    state [st], then it terminates in state [st'] and either signals
    that any surrounding loop (or the whole program) should exit
    immediately ([s = SBreak]) or that execution should continue
    normally ([s = SContinue]).

    The definition of the "[c / st || s / st']" relation is very
    similar to the one we gave above for the regular evaluation
    relation ([c / st || s / st']) -- we just need to handle the
    termination signals appropriately:

    - If the command is [SKIP], then the state doesn't change, and
      execution of any enclosing loop can continue normally.

    - If the command is [BREAK], the state stays unchanged, but we
      signal a [SBreak].

    - If the command is an assignment, then we update the binding for
      that variable in the state accordingly and signal that execution
      can continue normally.

    - If the command is of the form [IF b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI], then
      the state is updated as in the original semantics of Imp, except
      that we also propagate the signal from the execution of
      whichever branch was taken.

    - If the command is a sequence [c1 ; c2], we first execute
      [c1]. If this yields a [SBreak], we skip the execution of [c2]
      and propagate the [SBreak] signal to the surrounding context;
      the resulting state should be the same as the one obtained by
      executing [c1] alone. Otherwise, we execute [c2] on the state
      obtained after executing [c1], and propagate the signal that was
      generated there.

    - Finally, for a loop of the form [WHILE b DO c END], the
      semantics is almost the same as before. The only difference is
      that, when [b] evaluates to true, we execute [c] and check the
      signal that it raises. If that signal is [SContinue], then the
      execution proceeds as in the original semantics. Otherwise, we
      stop the execution of the loop, and the resulting state is the
      same as the one resulting from the execution of the current
      iteration. In either case, since [BREAK] only terminates the
      innermost loop, [WHILE] signals [SContinue]. *)
